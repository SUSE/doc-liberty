  <title>&uefisecboot; requirements</title>
  <para>
    To use &productname; on systems with &uefisecboot; enabled, the complete boot chain stack
    (shim, GRUB, and kernel) must be provided by &suse;. This is necessary because &uefisecboot;
    requires a strict chain of trust, where each component&mdash;from the firmware to the kernel
    and its drivers&mdash;must be signed with a key that the previous component in the chain
    explicitly trusts. Using non-&suse; components could break this chain and prevent the system
    from booting.
